MotivAid

Product Type

Mobile health (mHealth) application built with Flutter (frontend) and Supabase (backend).

Purpose

MotivAid is a mobile clinical decision-support and training application designed to assist midwives and frontline maternal healthcare workers in the early detection, prevention, and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) using the WHO-endorsed E-MOTIVE bundle.

The app bridges the gap between clinical guidelines and real-time practice in low-resource and low-connectivity settings, with strong emphasis on offline usability, structured workflows, decision support, and auditability.
