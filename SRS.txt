## Product Requirements Document (PRD) & Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

---

## 1. Document Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the **product requirements** and **software system specifications** for **MotivAid**, a mobile health (mHealth) application designed to support midwives and frontline healthcare workers in the early detection, prevention, and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) using the **E‑MOTIVE** clinical approach.

This PRD/SRS serves as a single source of truth for:

* Product vision and scope
* Functional and non‑functional requirements
* System architecture expectations
* Technical constraints for Flutter and Supabase implementation

### 1.2 Intended Audience

* Mobile developers (Flutter)
* Backend developers (Supabase)
* Product managers
* Clinical advisors
* Researchers and evaluators
* Donors and implementation partners

---

## 2. Product Vision

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Postpartum hemorrhage remains the leading cause of maternal mortality in low‑resource settings. Despite the availability of evidence‑based interventions such as the E‑MOTIVE bundle, gaps persist due to:

* Delayed recognition of PPH
* Inconsistent clinical decision‑making
* Limited access to continuous training
* Poor documentation and audit systems
* Weak connectivity and infrastructure

### 2.2 Product Vision

MotivAid aims to become a **trusted digital companion** for midwives, ensuring timely, standardized, and auditable application of the E‑MOTIVE approach at the point of care, even in offline and low‑resource environments.

### 2.3 Goals and Objectives

* Improve early detection of PPH
* Increase adherence to E‑MOTIVE steps
* Reduce delays in life‑saving interventions
* Strengthen documentation and accountability
* Support continuous training and capacity building

---

## 3. Target Users & Personas

### 3.1 Primary Users

* Midwives
* Nurses
* Community Health Workers (CHWs)

### 3.2 Secondary Users

* Facility supervisors
* Maternal health program managers

### 3.3 System Administrators

* App administrators
* Health program implementers

---

## 4. Scope Definition

### 4.1 In‑Scope

* Clinical decision support for PPH
* Training and simulation
* Offline‑first mobile usage
* Automated documentation and audits
* Supabase‑backed authentication and analytics

### 4.2 Out‑of‑Scope (Initial Version)

* Direct patient‑facing features
* Billing or insurance systems
* Hardware integrations (wearables, sensors)

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

---

### 5.2 Maternal Risk Assessment

**FR‑03**: The system shall allow entry of maternal risk factors (parity, anemia, history of PPH, etc.).

**FR‑04**: The system shall generate a PPH risk profile and flag high‑risk cases.

---

### 5.3 Clinical Mode (E‑MOTIVE Workflow)

**FR‑05**: The system shall provide a step‑by‑step E‑MOTIVE checklist during delivery.

**FR‑06**: The system shall display real‑time prompts for:

* Uterine massage
* Oxytocin and alternative uterotonics
* Tranexamic acid
* IV fluids

**FR‑07**: The system shall calculate and display the shock index (HR ÷ SBP).

**FR‑08**: The system shall trigger alerts when predefined clinical thresholds are exceeded.

---

### 5.4 Escalation & Communication

**FR‑09**: The system shall provide one‑tap emergency escalation.

**FR‑10**: The system shall support SMS or in‑app alerts to designated team members.

---

### 5.5 Documentation & Audit

**FR‑11**: The system shall automatically log all interventions with timestamps.

**FR‑12**: The system shall generate PPH case reports suitable for audits and maternal death reviews.

---

### 5.6 Training & Simulation Mode

**FR‑13**: The system shall provide simulated PPH scenarios.

**FR‑14**: The system shall include quizzes and case‑based assessments.

**FR‑15**: The system shall track training performance over time.

---

## 6. Non‑Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance

* The app shall respond to user input within 300ms under normal conditions.
* Critical alerts shall be displayed immediately.

### 6.2 Offline Capability

* The app shall function fully without internet connectivity.
* Data shall sync automatically when connectivity is restored.

### 6.3 Usability

* UI shall be optimized for low literacy environments.
* Large buttons and minimal text shall be used.
