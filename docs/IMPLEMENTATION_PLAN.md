# MotivAid - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a **sprint-by-sprint implementation plan** for building MotivAid with a **unit-based architecture**. The implementation follows an incremental approach, focusing first on core authentication and user/supervisor mobile interfaces, with the administrator panel deferred to a Next.js web application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **fresh start** implementation using local Supabase CLI (`npx supabase`). All database migrations will be created from scratch.

**Focus Areas:**
1. ✅ Foundation & Database Setup
2. ✅ Authentication & User Management
3. ✅ User (Midwife) Mobile Interface
4. ✅ Supervisor Mobile Interface
5. ✅ Clinical Features
6. ✅ Offline Sync & Polish

## Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

### Profiles Table
```sql
-- Users see their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Supervisors see profiles in their units
CREATE POLICY "Supervisors see unit members" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM unit_memberships um
      JOIN units u ON um.unit_id = u.id
      WHERE um.profile_id = profiles.id
      AND u.id IN (
        SELECT unit_id FROM unit_memberships
        WHERE profile_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'approved'
      )
    )
  );
```

### Units Table
```sql
-- Users see units they belong to
CREATE POLICY "Users see their units" ON units
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM unit_memberships
      WHERE unit_id = units.id
      AND profile_id = auth.uid()
      AND status = 'approved'
    )
  );
```

### PPH Cases Table
```sql
-- Midwives see cases in their units
CREATE POLICY "Midwives see unit cases" ON pph_cases
  FOR SELECT USING (
    unit_id IN (
      SELECT unit_id FROM unit_memberships
      WHERE profile_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'approved'
    )
  );

-- Supervisors see cases in units they manage + facility-wide
CREATE POLICY "Supervisors see facility cases" ON pph_cases
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles p
      WHERE p.id = auth.uid()
      AND p.role = 'supervisor'

          WHERE profile_id = auth.uid()
        )
        OR
        -- Cases in their facility
        pph_cases.facility_id IN (
          SELECT facility_id FROM unit_memberships um

      )
    )
  );
```

## Supabase Local Development Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI globally
npm install -g supabase

# Navigate to project directory
cd motivaid

# Initialize Supabase
npx supabase init

# Start local Supabase (Docker required)
npx supabase start
```

### Creating Migrations
```bash
# Create a new migration
npx supabase migration new create_profiles_table

# Edit the migration file in supabase/migrations/
# Example: supabase/migrations/20260126120000_create_profiles_table.sql
```

### Applying Migrations
```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
npx supabase migration up

# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npx supabase db reset
```

### Testing Locally
```bash
# Access local Supabase Studio
# Open http://localhost:54323 in browser

# Get local connection details
npx supabase status
```

### Connecting Flutter App to Local Supabase
```dart
// lib/core/config/supabase_config.dart
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

Future<void> initSupabase() async {
  await Supabase.initialize(
    url: 'http://localhost:54321', // Local Supabase URL
    anonKey: 'your-local-anon-key', // Get from `npx supabase status`
  );
}
```

|------|--------|---------------------|
| Supabase local setup issues | High | Document setup thoroughly, provide troubleshooting guide |
| Complex RLS policies | High | Test RLS policies extensively, create test users for each role |
| Offline sync conflicts | Medium | Implement robust conflict resolution, prefer server state |
| Low-end device performance | Medium | Test on low-spec devices, optimize early |
| User adoption resistance | Medium | Comprehensive training, simple UX |
| Data loss during sync | High | Implement sync queue with retry mechanism, never delete local data until confirmed synced |
